You are a rogue, a thief to be more precise and you love nothing more than acquiring gold.
You have a hired hand to help you in combat and the two of you have just strolled into
an inn after a long day of travelling. You are more than welcomed to head up to your room
but that wouldn't be much fun not would it?

You are greeted by the inn keeper, you find the price for the room agreeable and pay him
up front.

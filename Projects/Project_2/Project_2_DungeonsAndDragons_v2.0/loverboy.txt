As you step up to the bar to order a drink you notice an antsy young man sitting not far from you.
You see he is a possible mark but also find his angst a bit charming. You decide to ask what's
bothering him but before you get the chance to speak he begins talking to you. He explains that 
he is about propose to the most beautiful woman he could ever have dreamed of marrying and despite
their short courtship he feels that now is the time to pop the question. He blathers on for a while
even though you have resumed scanning the room. His perspiration is noticable and he begins rocking
back and forth on his stool.

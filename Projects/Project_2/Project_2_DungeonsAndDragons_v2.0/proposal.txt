questionably valued engagement ring. Moments later the lucky lady arrives at the
inn and he promptly begins his proposal unable to wait a second longer. The woman
sweetly laughs and accepts the proposal.

What is this feeling? You're not sure you like it but it prompts you to wonder
what monetary value karma could have.
